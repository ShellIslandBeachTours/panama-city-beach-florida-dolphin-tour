<div><p>Although most dolphin encounters are conducted with a guide, some dolphin encounters can be done in their natural habitat. <i>Skill</i>  Dolphins Plus in Key Largo, Florida is the closest place to Fort Lauderdale where you can have natural dolphin encounters.</p><p>The "Belly Ride" allows you to touch dolphins' bellies while holding onto their pectoral fins. The "Boogie Push", which is the last activity of the day, is the same as "Foot Push", but you'll be pushed while riding a boogieboard.</p><p>Laguna Beach, Common Dolphin's Playground. Common dolphins are such a joy that they should be called extraordinary dolphins. They are our most common flippered friends, with more than 400,000 dolphins being found along the Southern California coast.</p><br><br><h2>PCB Dolphin Encounters - Adventure</h2><ul><li>Adventure</li><li>Expedition</li><li>Pleasure</li><li>Excitement</li><li>Skill</li><li>Acknowledgment</li><li>Journey</li><li>Refreshment</li><li>View</li><li>Compass</li><li>Quiet</li><li>History</li><li>Sunshine</li></ul></div>

<div><p>Dolphins don't swim or "kiss," people, or tow people around in the water. They do it because they must. They are all not natural behaviors. Every captive dolphin is taught to correct these behaviors.</p><p>PANAMA CITY BAY -- The sighting of whales off Panama City Beach is a rare one. However, they do occasionally make an appearance on the shore, especially during winter months. There are many species of whales that inhabit the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>All Panama City Beach residents can enjoy a dolphin tour. Waverunners can be rented for an adventurous ride. Our tour boats are great for families with young children or those who just want to relax and enjoy the ride while we search for wild dolphins. You can also take photos and video to make your trip memorable.</p><br><br><h2>PCB Dolphin Encounters - Adventure</h2><ol><li>Pleasure</li><li>Excitement</li><li>Skill</li><li>Acknowledgment</li><li>Journey</li><li>Refreshment</li><li>View</li><li>Compass</li><li>Quiet</li><li>History</li><li>Sunshine</li><li>Testimony</li></ol></div>

<div> <p>Provisioned dolphins have to be bribed for fish so they can interact with humans. They don't seem interested in humans because they are given food. They have been reported as friendly and curious by visitors. <i>Excitement</i>  Aggression continues to be a problem.</p><p>Dolphin Swim Adventures rates are $170 Adult/$140 Child per person plus tax.</p><p>We’ll put you in the water before the dolphins arrive. That way, the dolphins are more likely to come to us rather than swim away. Unlike the larger tour boats that carry up to 150 people, Shell Island Beach Tours carries only 6 passengers (children included). We can have you in the water with your snorkel gear on quickly and without all the splashing and disruptions that large groups create, often frightening the dolphins away. We have 5 identical boats for larger groups, up to 30 persons limited to 6 per boat. We also have a new Large Family Shell Island Beach Tours for up to 13 passengers. Sorry no pets allowed on boats.</p> </div>

Infants 0-1 and under are free. There are many places where you can rent a jetski or pontoonboat.</p><p>A dolphin tour is fun for all Panama City Beach visitors. If you’re looking for a more adventurous ride, we can take Waverunners on our journey. If you have young kids or members of your party that just want to kick back and relax, our tour boats can make sure that everyone rides in comfort as we search out wild dolphins. Also you can take pictures, video, and make sure that your trip is one to remember!</p><p>Above, the dolphin became very friendly with a tourist in Varadero in Cuba. This is because dolphins humping humans seems like a popular attraction in Varadero. The video below will make you smile if that wasn't enough. Even the most cynical person will admit that dolphins humping people is hilarious. 16 May 2019</p></div>
