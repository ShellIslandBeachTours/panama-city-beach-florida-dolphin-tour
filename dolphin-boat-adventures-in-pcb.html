<div><p>We will put you in water before the dolphins come. By doing this, dolphins are more likely than not to swim away to us to find us. Shell Island Beach Tours only has six passengers (including children) and is not like larger boats with up to 150 passengers. We can quickly get you on the water wearing your snorkel gear without the disruptions and splashing that large groups cause. This is often what scares the dolphins away. We have 5 identical boats to accommodate larger groups. There is also a Large Family Shell Island Beach Tours that can hold up to thirteen passengers. Please no pets allowed on boats.</p><p>Discovery Cove gate prices All-Inclusive Dolphin Swim Program - $265.19 per person, tax inclusive</p><p>Pier Park, Panama City Beach is the best spot to stay.
