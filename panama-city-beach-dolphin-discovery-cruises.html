Americans have enjoyed seeing dolphins tricks for fish for many decades at marine attractions all over the country. However, wild dolphins are now protected by more safeguards.</p><p>You can swim with dolphins at many warm-water destinations, including Hawaii and Mexico, Florida, the Bahamas, and Florida. The typical cost of a shallow-water interaction[1] is around $80-$145. <b>Acknowledgment</b>  This will depend on the resort and the dolphins' behavior.</p></div>
