<div><p>The season for sea turtles can last from April through November in Destin. It's much more common to see these magnificent creatures in July and august. Destin's famous East Pass was Man-Made. They dug a path that ran from Choctawhatchee Bay up to the Gulf of Mexico. Evidently, they were right. The flood waters rose and were rushed through the excavations, creating the East Pass.</p><p>You attract dolphins by creating a floating object, sweetening the waters with pilchards or Spanish sardines and ballyhoo. <i>Shoreline</i>  It's an efficient way to score points, while also allowing you to chat with friends and enjoy some tunes.</p><p>"Had fun on our tour. Alex was a great skipper, and the kids had a blast. Second trip is a learning experience so we will be more prepared next time and know what to expect.</p></div>
