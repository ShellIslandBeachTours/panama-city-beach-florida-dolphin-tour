<div> <p>Dolphins are wild and will bite people who are upset, frustrated, or afraid. They can be disturbed by people trying to swim with them. <b>Excitement</b>  Dolphins who have become career-begging smugglers can be aggressive and pushy.</p><p>October Panama City Beach's clearest month is September 13. It lasts 9.0 months and ends around June 12. October is Panama City Beach's clearest month. It averages clear skies, partly cloudy, or mostly clear 64% of the year.</p><p>Dolphins are able to breathe through their blowhole located on the top portion of their head. The interesting thing about dolphins is that they can still experience respiratory irritation. It could result in the equivalent to someone coughing or sneezing. The dolphins' coughing experience is called "chuffing".</p></div>

<div> <p>It is worth the wait once you arrive. It is truly breathtaking. It's like swimming in an ocean. We didn't really know what we were getting into so we planned to spend just a few hours on this island. Do not expect to spend the entire day here!</p><p>Stories of dolphins protecting sailors were shared by the ancient Greeks, as well as Flipper. This idea is not surprising. Unfortunately, there isn’t any solid evidence that this is true.</p><p>Imagine yourself riding a boat or a jetski along with a pod of bottlenoses dolphins as you cruise over the Gulf of Mexico. <b>Pleasure</b>  The sea salt is in your hair and the sun is shining. You're enjoying adventure on the coast next to these marine creatures.</p></div>
